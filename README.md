Bullet3Blender (B3B)
==============

A special version of blender with bullet 3 OpenCL Gpu Rigid body systems
This will be used to run a blender open game -Wrectified 
but will in no way be limited to only this purpose, 
the real idea is to open up game development to all.


The game will feature in game component based assemblies, 
Real time dynamic physical actors, and integrate cutting edge science in the story.


Goal 100%
Using Bullet 3 and adding bindings to blender, Integrate gpu solved rigid body physics,
as well as create a limited python api function for both blender internal and game engine,
as well as potentially revamp logic.

Goal Sub
the lessons learned in the test build will allow blender 3x to integrate bullet 3, as well as showcase
rigid body actors.


Goal 125%
Special low level support will be added to blender to support animation using rigid bodies as armaure bones, skipping IK calculations and using Rigid body limits instead.

Goal 150%
Integrate a system to teach physics, coding and mathmatics using test environemnts and visual display
